Mechanical Protective Textiles,"The purpose of chemical protective clothing and equipment is to shield or isolate individuals from the chemical, physical, and biological hazards that may be encountered during hazardous materials operations. During chemical operations, it is not always apparent when exposure occurs. Chemical Protective Clothing is used mainly to prevent exposure during hazardous activities. These hazards can be grouped into categories such as chemical, thermal, nuclear, radiation (X-rays, UV) and biological hazards."

Puncture Resistant Gloves
The mechanical performance of fabrics is due to hybrid yarns in their interlacing. Textiles for mechanical protection can be manufactured from high strength textile fibres used alone or along with metallic fibres. MPT's have a personal protective function against different risk such as ballistic, blade cuts, fabric puncture, projection of fragments, knives, slashing etc besides combined use of high performance material such as glass fibre, HT Polyethylene or steel."
Radiation Protection,"Ballistic protection is a class of protective clothing, which aims at protecting the individuals from the bullets and steel fragments from hand-held weapons and exploding ammunitions. The basic idea of spreading the load over a large area is still applied. It is better to dissipate the energy of impact by deformation and breaking the protective material. Ballistic protection process is a complex phenomenon involving the transverse velocity propagation, tensile properties and the fine structure. In the recent years, use of ultra-high modulus polyethylene (UHMPE) fibres produced by gel spinning has been started in manufacturing of ballistic protective fabrics."
SPECIAL GEAR CAN PROTECT FROM SOME RADIATION,"SPECIAL GEAR CAN PROTECT FROM SOME RADIATION
Alpha particles stopped by protective garments.
Some beta particles penetrate the garments.
Most gamma rays penetrate the Radiation Detection.
Workers and officers working in nuclear plants and those working at & near the source of radioactive raw materials are prone to frequent exposure to alpha, beta and gama radiations. Radiation protection is also necessary for X- ray professionals, workers in cancer treatment centers and other places subject to ionizing radiation. An important aspect of most radiation protection programs at nuclear facilities is the protection of workers from radioactive contamination while handling radioactive materials or working in radioactively contaminated environments. In this regard, protective clothing is used extensively to protect workers from contamination."
UV Protective Finish,"UV Protective Finish
The aim of ultraviolet protective finish is to reduce a person's UVR exposure. Electromagnetic radiations of wavelength between 150 and 400 nm are termed as Ultraviolet rays. Approximately 10% of sun's energy is in the form of ultraviolet radiations. Atmosphere absorbs most of the noxious radiations emitted by the sun, only 5% of the harmful radiations reach to the surface of the earth. UV absorbers such as Benzotriazole and phenyl benzotriazole are able to absorb the damaging UV rays of sunlight. UV absorbers convert UV energy in to harmless heat energy. The UV blocking capacity of a fibre can be improved by incorporating TiO, into its structure."
Clean Room Textiles,"Clean Room Textiles
Anticontaminant Mask & Dress
Clean Room Garments
Clean room is a work area with controlled temperature and humidity to protect sensitive equipment from contamination. Clean room operators are required to wear special non-linting body suits, overshoes, gloves, head coverings and masks. In some clean rooms, workers even pass through an air blast upon entering to remove particles and ensure minimal contamination of the environment. Clean room textiles should be lint-free, antistatic and resistant to human contamination such as from hair or dead skin."
Metallized Fabrics Applications,"Conductive Textiles
Cut Resistant Fabrics
Nonwoven Textiles
Metallized products are used in various industrial, speciality and protective clothing applications. Metallized fabrics provide good abrasion resistance, reflectivity over extended time, wear resistance and molten splash resistance. Some applications of metallized fabrics in textiles are mentioned below
1.Coating /laminating fabric with metal surfaces for better heat reflection.
2.Blending metal sliver with natural/synthetic fibres to produce conductive textiles.
3.Composite yarns made of metal fibres yarns and textile yarns are suitable for cut resistant fabrics
4.Chopped metal fibres can be air or wet layered with textile fibres to form nonwoven textiles"
